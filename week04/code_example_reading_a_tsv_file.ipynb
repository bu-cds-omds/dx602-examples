        "  In this case, it is being used to strip the newline character `'\\n'` marking the end of the line.\n",
        "  Each line except maybe the last one will end with the newline character, but it is not really data, just a separator between lines.\n",
        "* The [string method `str.split`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split) breaks up the original string and returns the pieces in a list. The original string is not actually changed.\n",
        "* Sometimes, functions like this are written to return tuples of data to discourage accidental changes.\n",
        "  This requires marginal extra code - just add `tuple()` to the yield statement.\n",
        "  However, this makes changes like parsing numbers from strings more inconvenient, so its probably better to leave it as a list.\n",
        "* All the values in the returned rows will be strings.\n",
        "  You will eventually want to convert them to other types.\n",
        "* This code is unlikely to have errors if the file exists and you can read it, but unexpected results may happen if the columns are inconsistent.\n",
        "  * This code has no checks if the number of columns in each row are the same. Usually, you should at least check if the number matches the header (first) row.\n"
